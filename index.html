    <h3>Devloper, Gamer, Artist
    <p>Interested in becoming a programer and learning the building blocks</p>
    <h4>Do not stand at my grave and weep<br>
      I am not there. I do not sleep.<br>
      I am a thousand winds that blow.<br>
      I am the diamond glints on snow.<br>
      I am the sunlight on ripened grain.<br>
      I am the gentle autumn rain.<br>
      When you awaken in the morning's hush<br>
      I am the swift uplifting rush<br>
      Of quiet birds in circled flight.<br>
      I am the soft stars that shine at night.<br>
      Do not stand at my grave and cry;<br>
      I am not there. I did not die.<br> - Written by Mary Elizabeth Frye <h4>

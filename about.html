      Gaming<br><br>
      I like playing games because its an escape and and lets me just be me with my friends<br>and stay connected to people that are across the world from me and still being able to talk
      to them makes<br> it really nice and get interesting stories from both sides.  
      <ul>
        <li>World of Warcraft</li>
        <li>Escape From Tarkov</li>
        <li>Dark Souls</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Model Making<br><br>
      I like making game models because not only can I use them<br>
      but I can make other models and learn from others that also make models<br>
      and learn new techniques and make some friends!
    </p>
    <p>
      Volleyball<br><br>
      Volleyball is really fun maybe because I play a postion that not a lot of people enjoy<br>
      but because it really feels like a team sport and brings out the egotitical version of me <br>
      and get to see how competitive others are and brings out the real them.
